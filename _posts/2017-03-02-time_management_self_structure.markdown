Coming to the end of the Ruby on Rails section has been intimidating to say the least. I’ve beaten my head up against quite a few walls with this section, but the real culprit here has been structuring my time wisely. 

Unfortunately I made the mistake that we are all warned against when choosing a project. I went to for something that interested me, was too complex, and overwhelmed me to the point of not being able to start. Well I did start, but too many times without thinking, “how about you start simple and build out the complexity as you go, instead of starting all over again tomorrow”. When you’re in the midst of something that you think you can break down, it goes without saying, you should probably be able to step back and say, this is still too complex. 

I’ve been reading a lot of ‘noob programmer’ mistakes blogs/ journals/ articles etc.

Its kind of ironic that we spend a whole unit building the TODOMVC and I can barely stick to my own TODO lists, or keep the scope of my TODO lists reasonable. 

A humorous TODO app I found( and can’t remember the source) was simply, adding one thing to your list. You could only add another item, once you finished the first thing you put on your list. hah! so astute! I should have tried this model.

Another piece of noob programmer info I found that really stuck with me, was ‘attempt to google with the correct keywords’ and open the first ten links that come up. Usually what you are googling for is near the top of the page or you can deduce that something is worth clicking on by the description of the link. I think this method of opening up every link and seeing what a ‘link-that-has-no-use-to-me’ looks like it incredibly valuable and also ex-ing out of something I deem not useful also has its reward factor. The author of this post mentioned as you become a better googler/programmer you can open fewer and fewer tabs. 

So instead of choosing to write about some tricky pieces of Rails, which will come in the next blogs posts, I decided my first post about reviewing this section of the course, would be discussing time management. I’ve been looking for ways to structure my time better, life hacks if you will. I noticed that Avi and the other Learn instructors seem to have their schedules down to the minute. They set aside chunks of time like building blocks, I’m sure if I saw any of their google calendars they would be hyper-scheduled down to the minute. Thinking about this approach to time management was interesting, but Im not sure I can just jump into being a ‘general idea’ todo-list-maker to hyper-scheduling every minute. 

I’ve been trying a new technique for managing my time and creating bite sized chunks of ‘what you think you can accomplish’ in 25 minutes. 

This technique is called the [Pomodoro Technique]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) 

from the wiki the techniques is structured as such :
1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).[1]
3. Work on the task until the timer rings. If a distraction pops into your head, write it down, but immediately get back on task.
4. After the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper.[5]
5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.


After a few days of trying this technique, I have noticed that my reasoning of problems, whether working through my programs logic or just telling myself that this is an accomplishable (bite-sized) task, has been much more on task and I find myself following through with my plans more. I have also enjoyed ending my day with a ‘list of distractions’ aka an alternative TODO list. Sometimes my distraction list is very helpful and relieves me of feeling like i have a million other things to do, sometimes my distraction list is humorous and a good laugh.

With anything, I think easing into a hyper-structured reality for yourself takes time and should probably be taken slowly, unfortunately/ fortunately I am the kind of person who likes to dive in right away, get very excited, and sometimes I burn out too fast. 

The Pomodoro Technique has helped me resuscitate my drive to LEARN which was starting to lag and attempt to get back on track.
